Context
The purpose of this project is to predict the probability of admission for students based on several metrics given below. 
This project is for personal practice into machine learning, data cleaning and dealing with multicollinearity. There are 2 files containing
my code:
1. "Task 1_Admission Prediction.ipynb" uses scikit learn and ignores effects of multicollinearity
2. "Task 1_Neural networks.ipynb" uses neural networks and deals with multicollinearity

Content
The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.
The parameters included are :

GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
University Rating ( out of 5 )
Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )
Acknowledgements
This dataset is inspired by the UCLA Graduate Dataset. The test scores and GPA are in the older format.
The dataset is owned by Mohan S Acharya.
